# BlueTools
An application for Android devices allowing the use of multiple bluetooth speakers. Additionaly stereo and surround sound functions, aswell as EQ and mixing functions for each individual speaker are planned. We are also trying to implement Bluetooth passthrough possibilities.
# Android Wear
We are planning to provide an Android Wear extension to the Application, functioning as a remote control for EQ and mixer.
# iOS
We hope to be able to port this app to iOS, once the Android version is finished. An Apple Watch port is also planned.
# Future PC/Mac/Linux port
We hopefully will be able to port this application to PC, Mac and Linux once the mobile versions are finished. Right now our focus lies solely on the mobile versions(especially the Android version).
# Extemely early pre-Alpha warning
This Application is currently in a pre-Alpha state and may not do anything if you decide to compile the source and install it on your Android device. It may aswell break your device completely. We are not responsible for anything you do with our code.
